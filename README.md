## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Neuroscience Master Student at Philipps University Marburg.

Currently I am working on modeling the flies neural circuit for orientational cognition.

I am interested in dynamical systems as artificial model for biological cognition and potential alternative to current AI models.
